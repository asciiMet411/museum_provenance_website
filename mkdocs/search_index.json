These tools transform traditional written provenenance records into searchable data, with an emphasis on existing data standards and a strong focus on building tools that are useful (and usable) across multiple institutions.\n\n\nOnce we have converted our provenance information into structured data, we can ask complex questions like \u201cWhich works in our collection were in the same city in the same year?\u201d or \u201cWhich artworks in our collection were owned by an artist whose work is also in our collection?\u201d By doing more with the data we already have, we can discover gaps in knowledge, shape collections policy, and better understand the ecosystem of the collection and the institution. \n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nThe \nCMOA Provenance Standard\n is a strict superset of the AAM provenance standard, designed to resolve ambiguities and provide guidance and machine-readability. A draft version has been published.  Examples of \nrecords written using this style\n are available.\n\n\nArt Tracks: Visualizing the stories and lifespan of an artwork\n\n, was a paper on our work to-date on Art Tracks, presented at Museums \n the Web in April 2015.\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe Carnegie Museum of Art is attempting to structure provenance data so curators, scholars, and software developers can create visualizations that answer questions that would be difficult or impossible to answer without computer assistance. Provenance, the written description of the history of ownership and custody of art, is typically written as a list of the periods, places, and owners of an artwork. It captures the current best understanding of this history in a succinct and precise manner, and illustrates the gaps and uncertainties that still remain. Provenance is typically written as semi-structured text, following an institution-defined format. It would be useful to have a structured, computer-readable format for this data, allowing for search, visualization, and aggregated research. The American Alliance of Museums suggested standard, widely used across museums, is not defined with enough specificity to allow automated extraction of the structured data contained within provenance texts. Also, the provenance record model in collection management systems (CMS) is often not designed for structured data or does not provide a way to verify that the provenance text matches the structured data. A comprehensive text-based provenance standard, paired with a software library that can parse records written using this standard and convert them into structured data, would allow existing workflows to remain in place while allowing structured data to be automatically extracted from provenance records. The records could continue to be stored within existing CMS databases but contain machine-readable data for use in research and visualization. Outside of data itself, the stories these objects hold are often moving and sometimes astonishing. This ability to ask impossible questions and receive answers previously inaccessible across a museum\u2019s collection and (eventually) across many museums\u2019 collections is a resource art historians and scholars will find extremely valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Tools\n\n\nThe \nmuseum_provenance\n library is the core technology developed for this project.  It takes provenance records and converts them into structured, well-formatted data.\n\n\nThe \nElysa\n tool is a user interface designed for museum professionals.  It assists with verifying, cleaning, and modifying provenance records. \n\n\n\n\nInitial funding for this project was provided in part by a generous grant by the \nInstitute of Museum and Library Services\n.",

            "text": "Specifiying a Provenance Record.\n\n\nDraft Version, March 14, 2015\n\n\nStatement of Problem\n\n\nAt the Carnegie Museum of Art, as with many institutions, provenance is recorded in a text field within our collections management system.  As such, there is no machine-readable structure, and it is difficult or impossible to automatically analyse the data contained within.\n\n\nOne of the primary goals of Art Tracks is to defined a model and structure for storing and capturing the data within provenance in a machine-readable format.  \n\n\nCurrent Standards\n\n\nTraditional provenance records, while text, are designed to communicate research effectively and tersely.  As such, there are loose standards defined.\n\n\nThe most common of these standards was defined by the American Association of Museums, in \nThe AAM Guide to Provenance Research\n:\n\n\n\n\nProvenance information should be presented in a clear and organized fashion and be as complete as possbile.  The sequence of ownership should be easily understood.  The order of ownership may be earilest to latest owner, or the reverse, as long as the chronology is obvious.  There should be some mechanism by which owners are distinguished from dealers or auctioneers.  The sources of information about each owner or transaction shuld be documented.  In publishing provenance information, the museum should include an explanation of its format.\n\n\n..the provenanace is listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest known owner.  Life dates of owners, if known, are enclosed in brackets.  Uncertain information is indicated by the terms \"possibly\" or \"probably\" and explained in footnotes.  Dealers, auction houses, or agents are enclosed in parentheses to distinguish them from private owners.  Relationships between owners and methods of transactions are indicated by punctuation: a semicolon is used to indicate that the work passed directly between two owners (including dealers, auction houses, or agents), and a period is used to seperate two owners (including dealers, auction houses, or agents) if a direct transfer did not occur or is not known to have occured.  Footnotes are used to document or clarify information.\n\n\n\n\nAn informal survey of American museums indicate that most museums that explicitly reference a format either use this standard directly or use a modified version with either additions or minor structural modifications.\n\n\nAs such, basing our structured data model off this recommendation seems a wise course of action.\n\n\nTechnical Considerations\n\n\nGiven the underlying structure of the provenance information, we considered several possibliities for the canonical reference for this information.  To do so, we developed the following set of guidelines for describing our goals\n\n\n\n\nProvenance must be represented as unambiguous structured data.\n\n\nThere should only be a single source of truth for provenance data.\n\n\nThe provenance information should follow industry standards when available.\n\n\nProvenance should balance simplicity, capturing nuance, and unambiguity.\n\n\nInformation should not be discarded.\n\n\nThe system should be designed for usability.\n\n\nThe system should be as simple as possible.\n\n\nThe system should be technologically feasible.\n\n\nNot all information can be unambiguous.\n\n\nNot all information can be structured.\n\n\nThe current industry standard for provenance records is a paragraph of standardized text.\n\n\n\n\nDesigning for usability, as well as designing for a single source of truth, means that there exists a conflict between the traditional provenance record as a block of text and the requirements of structured data.\n\n\nOne option was to ignore the requirement for a single source of truth, and have both structured and unstructured representations of provenance data.  While technically the easiest option, it is very easy for the two sources of data to diverge, and there would be no method to detect such divergences.  Enforcing data constraints with policy tends to be less than optimal, and without a detection mechanism, experience has shown that one of the two systems will become untrusted.\n\n\nGiven that two versions of the data is non-optimal, the second option of converting provenance to structured data and treating the textual record as a produced artifact of the data is tempting.  This would allow the data to be the single source of truth.  This is also a technically appealing solution, since it allows the use of existing technological tools (such as relational databases) and simple data modelling constraints.\n\n\nThe major issues with this option revolve around usability.  Given that most museums do not have structured provenance data, in order for the structured data to be the single source of truth, all existing records would have to be converted immediately, or a transition period would have to be enforced where either no new information is added, or all information is added to both places.  Additionally, extensive training would have to be provided to all staff on how to read and write provenance information.\n\n\nAnother constraint is the flexibility of existing Collection Management Systems.  Either the CMS has to be extended to handle the new data, or there has to be a new tool added and maintained to store and handle the data.\n\n\nGiven these issues, the decision was made that the primary description of the structured data should remain the paragraph of provenance text.  This has the benefit of working with existing tooling, and also allowing a gradual conversion of records without problems; however, this presents its own issues.  The largest of these issues is that text is not traditionally an excellent source of unambiguity, and the structure of either English or the AAM guidelines is not sufficient to guarantee parsability.  \n\n\nDefinition of Provenance\n\n\n\n\nA provenance record is, at its core, a paragraph.\n\n\nEach paragraph describes the custody, location, and ownership of a work of art.\n\n\nEach paragraph is made of sentences, with each sentence representing an unbroken, known chain of custody.\n\n\nEach sentence has one or more clauses, separated by semicolons, that represent a single party who has had custody or ownership of the work of art.\n\n\nEach clause can also indicate its certainty.\n\n\nEach clause contains several data points, describing the party, the location, the method of acquisition, the dates of acquisition and deacquisition.\n\n\nEach data point can also indicate its certainty.\n\n\nEach clause can be annotated with footnotes, which contain additional, unstructured information about the clause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral format\n\n\n\n\nPossibly by descent to Vincent Price, the artist [1911?-1993], St. Louis, MS, before 1990 [1].\n\n\n\n\nCapitalization of the first letter\n\n\nIf this is the first record or the previous record ends in a period, capitalize the first word.  Otherwise, use standard capitalization (if it's a proper name, capitalize, if it's not, don't.)\n\n\nPeriod Certainty\n\n\nIf the entire period is uncertain, \nPossibly\n, otherwise nothing.\n\n\nAcquisition Method\n\n\nThe method of acquisition or transfer.\n\n\nControlled vocabulary\u2014 see \nlist\n\n\nUsually the acquisition method goes before the name.  For grammatical sanity, it will occasionally go after the name and the birth/death dates if present.  See the list for options here.\n\n\nName:\n\n\nThe name of the party.\n\n\n\n\nClaude Monet\n\n\n\n\nIf there are clauses, like, \"wife of previous\" or \"the artist\", they follow the name.  These clauses are a semi controlled vocabulary\u2014it can be extended as needed.  Please see the \nattached list\n for current exceptions and vocabulary.\n\n\n\n\nMichel Monet, son of the artist\n\n\n\n\nnot\n\n\n\n\nSon of the artist, Michel Monet\n\n\n\n\nIf the name is uncertain, follow the name with a question mark.\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Strait?\n\n\n\n\nnot\n\n\n\n\nPossibly George Strait\n\n\n\n\nThis prevents confusion around the question of which aspect is certain of uncertain, the party or the entire record.\n\n\nIf the party's name has multiple initials, use a space between them.\n\n\n\n\nJ. J. Abrams\n\n\n\n\nnot\n\n\n\n\nJ.J. Abrams\n\n\n\n\nFor estate and other sales, the party is the gallery or auction house that hosted the sale, not the name of the sale. The name of the sale should be contained within a footnote if known.\n\n\nIf the gallery is not known, the party is \"The estate of Claude Monet\" or something similar.\n\n\nIf the part is not known, use \nUnknown party\n or \nUnknown collector\n or something similar.  Don't leave it blank.\n\n\nIf the party is a marriage, and the work is co-owned by the parties of the marriage, the party should be\n\n\n\n\nMr \n Mrs. Marshall Fields III\n\n\n\n\nFor marriages, we are recording only the name of the man as per tradition.  If the wife's name is known, attach it in a footnote.\n\n\nThis is the marriage of these two people, not either of these people themselves.  Any dates or locations should refer to the marriage, and a transfer of provenance should occur if a marriage ends in either death or divorce. \n\n\nBirth and Death dates\n\n\nBirth and Death dates of a party. \nYears of operation if an organization.\n\nYears of marriage if a marriage.\n\n\nBirth and death dates are years, enclosed within braces and separated by a dash.\n\n\n\n\n[1880-1955]\n\n\n\n\nIf the date is unknown, or the party is still alive, exclude that date, but leave the dash.\n\n\n\n\n[1880-] or [-1955]\n\n\n\n\nIf either of the dates is uncertain, follow that date with a question mark.\n\n\n\n\n[1880?-1990]\n\n\n\n\nFor years BCE,\n\n\n\n\n[500BCE-450BCE]\n\n\n\n\nLocation.\n\n\nThe location of the owner of the artwork at the time of acquisition.\n\n\nIs this the main residence of the owner?\n\n\n\n\nBoston, MA\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n\n\nParis, France\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n\n\nHighclere Castle, Hampshire, England\n\n\n\n\nIf the location is uncertain, us a question mark following the last word of the location.\n\n\n\n\nGlasgow, Scotland?\n\n\n\n\nIf the location is in the US, record the city and the state (in zip code two letter abbreviated form, without periods, and with a comma between the city and the state.)\n\n\nIf the location is outside of the US, record the city, the provence or state (if required to prevent ambiguous locations), and the country.  Each of these should be seperated by a comma.\n\n\nIf the location is in a named, notable building, record that building.\n\n\nIf the location has changed names over time, The name of the location is the name of the location at the time of the acquisition.  i.e. Leningrad, not St. Petersburg, if the acquisition took place between 1924 and 1991.\n\n\nDo not record street names or street numbers.  If this is essential for the record this information can be recorded in a footnote.  Never attach specific identifying information of the party the Museum acquired the work from.\n\n\nPeriod of Ownership\n\n\nA description of the time period the work was owned by the party.\n \n\n\n\n\nbefore 1996\n\n\nUntil some time after the 15th Century\n\n\n1995 until 2006\n\n\n\n\nFor dates, the preferred forms are\n\n\n\n\n19th century\n\n\n1990s\n\n\n1990\n\n\nOctober 1990\n\n\nOctober 11, 1990\n\n\n\n\nYears before 1 CE are specified with BCE.\n\n\n\n\n5th century BCE\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty is indicated with a question mark following the last part of the date phrase\n\n\n\n\nuntil October 1885?\n\n\n\n\nYears are recorded in Gregorian form, using the October 4, 1582 as the first day of the Gregorian calendar.  For years earlier than 1582, use the proleptic Gregorian Calendar.\n\n\nThe year immediately preceding 1 CE is 1 BCE.  There is no year zero.\n\n\nStock Numbers\n\n\nTHIS IS DEPRICIATED, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED.  IT WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FINAL DRAFT OF THIS DOCUMENT.\n\n\nA associated stock number for the work in a sale.\n\n\nThis handles simple stock numbers within a record.  For any complicated record, or additional notes, or problematic records, use a footnote.\n\n\n\n\nstock no. 55512\n\n\nno. 55512\n\n\nlot a111\n\n\n\n\nLugt numbers\n\n\nWe are currently treating lugt numbers as a stock number (for expediency.)  The format is\n\n\n\n\n(L.12312a)\n\n\n\n\nIf there is an existing stock number, use one of the other.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nAdditional clarifying information, or any information that cannot be structured.\n\n\n\n\n[2]\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes are indicated by a number contained inside brackets at the end of a record.  It should be the last thing within the record, preceding the completing punctuation.\n\n\nThere should only be a single footnote per-owner.  If multiple notes are needed, they can be multiple sentences within the footnote.\n\n\nFootnotes can contain as much text as needed\u2014they are for clarity and people, not computers.\n\n\nClosing punctuation\n\n\nIf the artwork is \nknown\n to be a direct transfer, use a semicolon at the end of the period of ownership. \n\n\n\n\nMichel Buble, 1990;\n\n\n\n\nIf the artwork is \nnot\n known to be a direct transfer, use a period.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson, 1986.\n\n\n\n\nIf uncertain, assume that the transfer is \nnot\n direct.\n\n\nDealers and Auction Houses\n\n\nIf the owner is not a primary owner, wrap the entire ownership period in parenthesis. \n\n\n\n\n(Galarie Durand-Ruel, Paris, France, 1891);\n\n\n\n\nThis maintains the historic distinction between primary owners and the auctionners or dealers.\n\n\nNotes at the end of the record.\n\n\nOnce all owners are recorded, footnotes appear.\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:  [1] This is a note. [2] This is also a note.\n\n\n\n\nthe string ' NOTES: ' indicates that the footnote section is beginning.   each note is indicated by a number within brackets followed by the note.  Do not link multiple records to a single footnote\u2014duplicate the information if required.   That way, unintentional changes of one owner do not accidentally propagate to other sections.\n\n\n(due to technical reasons, there is a limit of 99 footnotes per-provenance text.

[3] For information on Lucien Bonaparte's ownership of this work, see B\u00e9atrice Edelein-Badie, \"La collection de tableaux de Lucien Bonparte, prince de Canino\", 1995, page 239 and generally. This work then appears on page 126, plate 28, of \"Choix de gravures \u00e0 l'eau-forte d'apr\u00e8s les peintures et les marbres de la galerie de Lucien Bonaparte\", published in 1812. It is then listed for sale in Bonaparte's auction on Febuary 6. 1815. [4] Bought in. [5] Because this work was bought in at the Bonaparte sale in 1815, in 1816 it appears in the \"Catalogue of the Splendid Collection of Pictures Belonging to Lucien Buonaparte, Prince of Canino\". It advertises an exhibition of works \"Now on private view at Chevalier Boyer's, No. 31 Leicester Square, London.\" Inside is a disclosure that \"Proposals for the Purchase of any of the Pictures in this Collection are to be made to the Chevalier Boyer, nephew of Lucien Buonaparte, Prince of Canino, at No. 31 Leicester Square.\" This work is listed as no. 80,  \"St. Augustine\" on page 22. The sale occurred on May 14-16, 1816. [6] This sale was entitled \"The beautiful, choice, and truly valuable collection of pictures, the property of Christian William Huybens, a bankrupt; comprising unusually fine specimens of the greatest masters of the Florentine, Roman, Venetian, Lombard, and Bolognese schools, with many exquiste bijoux of the renowned and highly coveted painters of Flanders and Holland\", and sold for \u00a368.5 according to the Getty Provenance Index. [7] his work was bought for Dfl 2,825. See \"'A small but choice collection'; the Art Gallery of King Willem II of the Netherlands\" by Hinterding and Horsch, pg. 108. [8] See Hinterding and Horsch, pg. 10. This work is recorded as being purchased by Nieuwenhuys in July of 1823, and then sold to King Willem II sometime after. [9] This work is bought in at this sale, failing to reach its reserve of Dfl. 8,000, only reaching Dfl. 7,400. See Hinterding and Horsch, pg 108. [10] Hinterding and Horsch list this work as being sold for Dfl. 6,000 to \"Weimar (art dealer) for Prince Hendrik\", referring to [11] Prince Hendrik, or Prince Willem Frederik Hendrik was the 3rd son of King Willem II of the Netherlands, and third in line for the throne. By 1850, Prince Hendrik was serving as Governor of Luxembourg, a post he served in until his death. [12] Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was the daughter of King Willem II, and the sister of Prince Hendrik. She married her first cousin, Karl Alexander August Johann, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, also known as Charles Alexander. [13] It is likely that this work descended to Willhelm Ernst through his grandfather, Grand Duke Charles Alexander, the spouse of Grand Duchess Sophie. When Grand Duke Charles Alexander died in 1901, Willhelm Ernst succeeded him as Grand Duke. This work is recorded as being in the possession of the \"Grand Duke, Weimar\" on page 191 in Bombe, \"Perugino: Des Meisters Gem\u00e4lde\", written in 1914, so we know that it was with Willhelm Ernst at this point during his reign as Grand Duke. It then appears again in Umberto Gnoli's \"Pietro Perugino\", 1923, page 68, where the location is recorded as Weimar, and the \"Castello\" [14] This work is recorded as being in \"Schlossmuseum Weimar\" in Fritz Knapp \"Perugino\", 1926, and is number 69 in the book. Following the abdication of Grand Duke Wilhem Ernst in 1923, the title of Grand Duke was abolished, and the Schloss Weimar was turned in to a museum. [15] Weininger lent this work to the Royal Academy, London, for their exhibition on Italian Art from 1200-1900, which ran from January 1 until March 20, 1930.

These account books form part of the Borghese archive, now part of the Vatican Secret Archives. They were transcribed by Italo Faldi in the Appendix documents of \"Nuove note sul Bernini\", Bolletino d'Arte, XXXVIII, No. 4, October-December 1953. [2] The Ludovisi family likely owned this work prior to 1682, but we know for certain that it was in their possession in 1682. In Baldinucci, \"Vita del Cavaliere Gio Lorenzo Bernino\", 1682, pg 104, two busts of Gregory XV are listed under \"Ritratti, e teste con busto\", one as \"Di Gregorio XV\" and the other, directly below, as \"altro di metallo\" and bracketed together as being \"in casa Ludovisi.\" The two busts appear together in Domenico Bernino's \"Vita del Cavlier Gio. Lorenzo Bernino\", 1713, pg. 22-23, where he writes that \" in marmo \n in Metallo de'quali tr\u00e9 preferentemente se ne veggono nella Casa Ludovisi.\"  In \"Ritratti di alcuni celebri pittori del secolo XVII\", Rome, 1731, pg. 140, the works are listed together again, however they are described as \"gi\u00e0 in Casa Ludovisi\". From these references, we infer that the bust left the possession of the Ludovisi between 1713 and 1731. [3] Records indicate that this work went to a \"Bolognese family related to the Ludovisi\" but does not clarify the family name or a specific member of the family. See correspondence from Wildenstein \n Co. in curatorial file. [4] Antonio Mu\u00f1oz records Stroganoff as having purchased this work from Corvisieri, an antiquarian in Rome. See Mu\u00f1oz \"Un'opera del Bernini ritrovata,\" Vita d'Arte, Volume VIII, Number 48, December 1911, pg. 187-190.  Stroganoff's name is also recorded as Count or Comte Stroganov, and as Gregorio Stroganoff. [5] This work was likely sold or dispersed between 1916 and 1928, as it is recorded in 1916 as \"the fine bust of Gregory XV by Bernini, now in the Stroganoff collection.\" by Mu\u00f1oz, \"Studi sul Bernini,\" L'Arte, Vol. XIX, 1916, pg. 103-104. But in 1928, Mu\u00f1oz reports that this work \"was formerly in the Stroganoff collection in Rome.\" in \"Roma Barocca, 2nd ed., Milan, 1928, pg. 104-105. It was definitely out of the collection by 1938, when it is mentioned as \"A remarkable bronze bust of this pope remained in Rome until the Stroganoff collection was dispersed.\" in T. H. Fokker, \"Roman Baroque Art\", Oxford, 1938, p. 137. [6] It is likely that Mu\u00f1oz acquired this work significantly before 1953, but it is referenced as being in his collection in Faldi, \"Nuovo note sul Bernini,\" Bollettino d'Arte, XXXVIII, No. 4, October-December 1953, pg. 311-313. See translated clipping in curatorial file via Wildenstein \n Co. Mu\u00f1oz published a catalog of the collection of Gr\u00e9goire Stroganoff in 1912 entitled \"Pi\u00e8ces de Choix de la Collection du Comte Gr\u00e9goire Stroganoff \u00e1 Rome\". A bust of Pope Gregory XV can be seen in a photograph of an interior room. Mu\u00f1oz authored at least 7 articles about Bernini and this work. [7] Rudolph Wittkower records this sculpture as being \"Formerly Mu\u00f1oz collection, Rome (Recently exported to U.S.A.)\" in his book \"Gian Lorenzo Bernini\", 2nd ed., 1966, pg. 180-181. Because of this note, we can assume that the work was out of Rome either in 1966 or before.\n\n\n\n\n71.4; Nicola di Maestro Antonio d'Ancona; Madonna and Child Enthroned with SS.

[2] This information comes from correspondence with  Matteo Mazzalupi, see curatorial file. [3] The work is recorded as being in Barker's ownership in 1854 by the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen. See Waagen, \"Treasures of Art in Great Britain\" 1854, v. II, page 128. [4] Hall's Place, in Harbledown near Canterbury, was a country home that underwent several changes in ownership and had many residents. It is uncertain which individual or family purchased this work. [5] George Richmond, R.A. attached a lengthy handwritten label found on the reverse of this work. On the label, he states that he purchased this work from Colnaghi, and records the early provenance of the work. It is dated December 4, 1885 and gives his address as 20 York Street, Portman Square W. [6] Auction entitled \"Pictures of the early English, Old Italian and Flemish Schools formed by the Late George Richmond, R.A. also a selection of the works of the late George Richmond, R. A.\" See copy of auction catalog and correspondence of February 1971. [7] An annotated catalog from the George Richmond, R.A. sale records Lesser as the buyer of this work. Lesser was a London art dealer. His sale to Vernon J. Watney is recorded in \"A Catalogue of Pictures and Miniatures At Cornbury and 11 Berkley Square, January 1915\", which was compiled by \"V. J. W.\" (Vernon J. Watney) on page 16 as \"Bought from Mr. L. Lesser, 1899.\" It is unclear if Watney purchased this work from Lesser privately or through his gallery. [8] Vernon Watney's label was attached to the reverse of this work, and this work was recorded in his catalog of artworks written in 1915. [9] She is also referred to as Lady Margaret Wallop, not to be confused with her daughter, Lady Rosalind Margaret Watney.

On page 56, Prachoff writes \"A la fin de l'ouvrage vou\u00e9 \u00e0 Clodion par Thirion (Les Adam et Clodion, Paris, 1885) ets annex\u00e9e une liste des oeuvres de Clodion qui on apparu aux ventes de 1767 \u00e0 1884- L'auteur parle entre autre d'une terre-cuite d'une \u00abpetit mod\u00e9le de la Vestale faite pour L'Imp\u00e9ratrice Catherine de Russie\u00bb..\"  [2] This work is listed as by \"Claudion\" and is described as \"Une vestale en terre cuite, petit modele de la figure que cet artiste a ex\u00e9cute en marbre pour l'Im\u00e9ratrice de Russie.\" This is consistent with the idea that Clodion executed this terracotta work in preparation for the marble Vestal for Catherine II. [3] Purchased for 245 livres, according to the Getty Provenance Index record for this sale. Lebrun's wife, the painter Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, painted the granddaughters of Catherine II, and was supposed to paint Catherine II's portrait, but the monarch died before before the sitting happened. [4] This sale happened at No. 95, rue de Cl\u00e9ry, Paris, France. This work is listed as \"Une Vestale voil\u00e9e et couronn\u00e9e de fleurs, tenant de la main droit une pat\u00e9re, et de la gauche un vase. Pr\u00e9s d'elle est plac\u00e9 un trepied de forme antique. Cette belle terre cuite fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e avec \u00e9tude recherch\u00e9e par cet artiste, dont les productions de ce genre sont toujours pr\u00e9cieuses aux amateurs de l'art.\"  The height of this work is listed as \"Hauteur, 18 pounces; lageur 7 pouces\". These measurements match the museum's sculpture. [5] This name is recorded differently- in \"Notes Sur Clodion, Statuaire, A propos Du Cabinet D'un Amateur, Par F. De Villars\", pg 21, a person by the name \u201cRadet\u201d is said to have purchased the work 1791 Lebrun sale for 60 francs. The Getty Provenance Index also lists this name as \u201cRadet\u201d. However, annotated catalogs of this same sale from the Frick Art Reference Library and the French Institut national de histoire de l\u2019art clearly record the name as \u201cRadel\u201d. [6] While the exact owner and purchase date is unclear, however we know the work was in the collection of the Stroganoff family by 1863, when it appears in a watercolor of the Stroganoff's library by Jules Mayblum. See \"Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble Family\", pg. 84, edited by Penelope Hunter-Stiebel. [7] Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, many private art collections, including that of the Stroganoff family, were nationalized. [8] This sale entitled \"Sammlung Stroganoff\", with this work sold as one of a pair listed as \"Zwei Terrakottastatuetten\" on pg, 232. This work sells as part of a pair with 68.33.2 for 9500 RM.The sale is being listed as \"Im auftrag der handelsvertretung der union der sozialistischen sowjet-republiken\". The auction catalog records the date of this sculpture as 1765, which is in error as the date signed on the sculpture is 1768.  [9] Sale entitled \" French modern paintings \n drawings, eighteenth century French furniture, marble and terra cotta sculptures, bronze dor\u00e9 objects of art ...Collected by the late Thelma Chrysler Foy\", this work listed as  \"Nymphe et Vestale\" on page 94.
